# TODO: Investigate what the situation is with Pygls and WorkspaceEdits.
# It seems that Pygls is only testing for receiving workspace edits from the client which
# I'm not sure makes much sense? This Dict patch converts a Pygls server from being able to
# receive a WorkspaceEdit response to being able to receive a Workspace Edit request.
# https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_applyEdit
# Ultimately I think this is fixed in the v1 branch?
